i3-work
=======

This repo contains my i3wm config along with some install scripts for fast setup on a CLEAN computer

This will change our git username to me, so change it afterwards with:

`git config --global user.name "YOURNAME"`


### Install EVERYTHING with one command

Don't run this unless you trust me and have verified the files contents:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viktorsmari/i3-work/master/bootstrap.sh| sh`
